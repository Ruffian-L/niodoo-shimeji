GEMINI DEEP RESEARCH PROMPT:
============================

Research Topic: "Autonomous AI-Controlled Desktop Companions Using Gemini API Function Calling"

Research Question:
How can Google Gemini API with function calling be used to create an autonomous, self-aware desktop companion character (Shimeji) that controls its own behavior, reacts to user context, and acts as an interactive NPC?

Specific Areas to Research:

1. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
   - Gemini API function calling capabilities and limitations
   - Best practices for autonomous agent loops with LLMs
   - How to structure function declarations for character control (jump, sit, walk, climb, etc.)
   - Rate limits and cost optimization for continuous autonomous operation
   - Context window management for long-running agents

2. DESKTOP INTEGRATION
   - Methods for desktop companion software to expose control APIs (HTTP REST, WebSocket, gRPC)
   - Shimeji/desktop pet architectures and existing implementations
   - Window tracking and screen context awareness on Linux/Windows/macOS
   - Speech bubble/overlay rendering techniques for character dialogue

3. AI AGENT DESIGN
   - Prompt engineering for autonomous character behavior
   - Personality consistency in long-running agents
   - Decision-making frameworks for when to act vs. observe
   - Balancing proactive behavior vs. user annoyance
   - Memory and context retention across sessions

4. SIMILAR PROJECTS & PRIOR ART
   - Existing AI-powered desktop assistants (Clippy, Cortana, etc.)
   - Modern LLM-based desktop agents
   - Shimeji implementations and their APIs
   - Desktop pet projects using AI/ML
   - Virtual pet AI research

5. USER EXPERIENCE CONSIDERATIONS
   - Optimal frequency of autonomous actions
   - Natural character behavior patterns
   - User interaction modes (click, voice, text)
   - Privacy concerns with screen monitoring
   - Resource usage and performance impact

6. ADVANCED FEATURES
   - Multi-character interactions (spawning friends, social behaviors)
   - Learning from user preferences over time
   - Integration with productivity tools and workflows
   - Emotional state modeling and expression
   - Voice synthesis for character speech

7. IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES
   - Handling API failures and network issues gracefully
   - Preventing repetitive or annoying behaviors
   - Ensuring character stays "in character" long-term
   - Managing state between restarts
   - Cross-platform compatibility

8. MONETIZATION & DISTRIBUTION
   - Freemium models for AI desktop companions
   - API cost management at scale
   - Distribution platforms (Steam, app stores, etc.)
   - Customization and modding support

Please provide:
- Technical architecture recommendations
- Code examples and API patterns
- Comparison of different approaches
- Potential pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Links to relevant documentation, papers, and projects
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Cost estimates for running such a system

Focus on practical, implementable solutions using:
- Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (free tier)
- Shijima-Qt or similar desktop pet frameworks
- Python for the agent logic
- HTTP REST APIs for character control
- Linux (Ubuntu/GNOME) as primary platform
